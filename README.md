Initial Screen


Working:

(1) Create bird and a wall prefab

(2) Design logic to generate, move and destroy the wall via Finite State Machine

(3) Design logic to make gravity act on bird and make it take vertical leaps using Finite State Machine

(4) Implement collisions

Tools: Unity, C#, Playmaker


Future extension: Bring in the bird character and walls with bricks
